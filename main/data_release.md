The Performance & Analytics Department maintains an inventory of high-value, public datasets to release on the Open Data Portal over the first 5 years of the policy. Learn more about how P&A created and is maintaining this inventory in [The Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Update](https://datasd.gitbooks.io/open-data-implementation-update-2016/content/main/prioritization.html). Review the inventory [here](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/data-inventory/). The 2016 update also contains information about how P&A determines the publication schedule for every dataset in the inventory.

For the launch of the Open Data Portal in June 2016, the City released 44 datasets from 11 City departments. Since then, 30 additional datasets from 9 departments have been published bringing the total datasets published on the portal during the first two fiscal years to 74. P&A exceeded a goal of publishing 27 percent of all datasets on the inventory by the end of Fiscal Year 2017 and is on track to meet a target of publishing 66 percent of all originally identified high-value public datasets during Fiscal Year 2018.

Each dataset released on the portal went through a [multi-step release process](https://datasd.gitbooks.io/open-data-implementation-update-2016/content/main/data_release.html). To release a dataset, the Data & Analytics team works with the data owning City department to get access to the source system, learn about the City program that collects the data and the role of the data in operations, learn about current and historical data collection and management practices, write code to extract the data from its source system, transform the extraction into a format that is suitable for publication, and stage the dataset on the portal for review. Some datasets are more complex than others and take longer to release.

Key datasets released during FY 17 include the following:

* Vehicle stops tracked by the Police Department
* Vehicle collisions tracked by the Police Department
* Streetlight point locations from the Environmental Services Department
* Active businesses from the City Treasurer enhanced with business coordinates and Business Improvement District name, if the business is located within one

* Public art locations from the Cityâ€™s Commission on Arts & Culture
* Energy usage in City buildings
